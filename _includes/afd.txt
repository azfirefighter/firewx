<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b><br>Dry weather will continue through the work week with a
slight chance of showers this weekend east of Tucson. winds will be
light today into Wednesday then become rather gusty again Thursday 
into Friday. Near normal temperatures through Wednesday then slightly
below normal into the weekend. 



<p><b>DISCUSSION</b><br>Back to seasonal weather through Wednesday with sunny 
skies, light winds and temperatures right about average for early 
December. Then a weather system will drop south across the area
Thursday into Friday lowering high temperatures nearly ten degrees
with an easterly breeze expected, primarily Thursday. There is not
much moisture for this system to work with so it looks like any
precipitation with this storm should be isolated to the higher
terrain near the New Mexico border.  

The weekend into early next week remains a fairly low confidence
period of time unfortunately. The deterministic runs of the various
models are really having a hard time on settling on a unified idea.
Even the ensembles of the various models are at odds on the details
that matter to our area. The situation is a complex one with an 
interesting split flow, nearly high over low pattern with meandering
upper level lows. At this time, I went with the idea of near to
slightly lower than average heights and primarily dry for the 
majority of the forecast area. Based on the year we have had, leaning
dry is best course of action until a strong signal shows up that 
points in the other direction.
