<p><b>SYNOPSIS</b><br>Dry weather will continue for the upcoming 7 days with
temperatures on a rollercoaster ride. Gusty southeasterly winds 
are likely late Sunday night into Monday morning and afternoon 
with lighter winds though mid week. 



<p><b>DISCUSSION</b><br>No significant changes from previous forecast
despite model uncertainties in the mid and long range. Guidance
struggling with the parade of shortwaves and closed lows moving
across the Western US the seven days. The main theme with any of 
these is a lack of precipitation, thus leading to a continued dry
stretch at this time. Temperatures will seesaw throughout the 
upcoming week, but generally staying in the 60s/70s for highs and 
30s/40s for lows. The colder higher elevation valleys south and 
east of Tucson will be in the 20s with isolated spots in the upper
teens for lows at times. 

As for the gusty southeast winds late Sunday night into Monday
morning and afternoon, model guidance continues to indicate a 
marginal event at this time. That translates to sustained winds of 
15-25 mph, with gusts around 35 mph. Some locally higher wind 
speeds are certainly possible in favored areas for southeast 
winds. The event still bears watching as HREF, WRFNAM, and NAM 
forecast soundings show potential for higher speeds. However, NBM
and most all other numerical and statistical guidance does not 
support these stronger winds. Still some time and will pass on 
this discussion to the day shift for further consideration of any 
wind adv headlines. Regardless of any headlines, people across 
the Tucson metro in the normally wind southeast wind areas, you 
know who you are, might want to watch those trash/recycling cans 
and loose yard objects that could be blown around.
