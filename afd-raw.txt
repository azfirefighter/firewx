Area Forecast Discussion
National Weather Service Tucson AZ
303 AM MST Thu Jan 14 2021

.SYNOPSIS...High pressure will bring a strong warming trend and
continued dry conditions through the weekend. A weather system
digging down from the north is expected to result in cooler
temperatures, occasional gusty winds and a chance for valley rain
and mountain snow showers next week.

&&

.DISCUSSION...A strong ridge of high pressure will build in from
the eastern Pacific and bring temperatures 10 to 12 degrees above
average through the weekend.

Ensembles suggest a split in the flow eroding the eastern flank of
the ridge early next week, opening our area up to a low pressure
system diving down from the north Tuesday and Wednesday. The only
question will be how deep the low digs before shearing back into
higher latitude support and shifting eastward. Latest ensemble
means suggest anomalous height depressions as far south as Sonora
and northern Baja. That would suggest a cut-off resolution with
significant timing issues before clearing from the west. As of now
the NBM handles this fairly well spreading the precip chances out
over several days, but is likely missing a favorable 12 to 24 hour
period where we have our highest PoPs and are currently
underforecasting precip chances for that period. When? It all
depends on how far south and west the split goes and that could be
as far south and west as northern Baja. Best guess is to lean
toward a higher amplitude but less progressive lower energy
pattern. That would slow things up a bit, and the best precip
chances for our corner of the state may end up later in the week.

&&

.AVIATION...Valid through 14/12Z.
Mostly clear with a few cirrus clouds possible. Normal wind 
trends generally less than 10 kts. Aviation discussion not updated
for TAF amendments.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...High and dry will continue into early next week. 
Above normal daytime high temperatures are forecast through Monday, 
peaking around 10 degrees warmer than normal Saturday before trending
downward. Minimum RH levels will be quite low with many valley areas
dipping into the single digits each day. Overall, winds will be 
light except picking up a bit out of the west on Saturday. A weather 
system moving in Tuesday will likely result in cooler temperatures 
and a chance of valley rain and mountain snow showers, especially 
east of Tucson.

.TWC WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...
None.
